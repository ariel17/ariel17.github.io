- _Ariel, aren't you going too fast?_: I must check project criticity. What is
  more valuable: 0 errors or multiple customs at the phone screaming at you? It
  must be truth always. Am I willing to take the risk to damage my image and
  client relation releasing to production a code untested? Am I crazy??
- API first design: it worths every time spent on it. Just choose a platform and
  implement it.
- Be open to other's solutions.
- Be *always* polite: it will keep the doors open always.
- _Men down!_: If motivation goes down for several days, the way to keep track
  of productivity is to pick the best day I had and compare to it. [Be the best
  version of yourself](https://twitter.com/PicardTips/status/1061346044384968704?s=08).
