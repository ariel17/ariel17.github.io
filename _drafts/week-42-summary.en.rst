.. description: Activity summary for week 42 of 2014.
.. type: text

Last week I was thinking on a way I could keep an activity registry. The
simplest thing I found was to do a summary close to weekend: a short period of
time to not forget the major of occurred events but long enough to let
interesting things to happen (but I have to prove it to myself this last one
:P).

Books I am reading/I readed
===========================

* |Rocannon|_ by `Úrsula K. Le Guin`_
* |PragProg|_ by `Andrew Hunt`_ and `David Thomas`_
* `Laravel 4 Official Documentation`_

Technology that I learned/I used
================================

* `Python Social Auth`_: Google's OAuth2 authentication handling (and other
  social platforms).
* `Google OAuth2`_: Application authorization for pushing events into client's
  Google Calendar.
* `Django Tastypie`_: Created an example project to show the framework powers 
  on a very high level.
* `Vagrant`_: Production server replication to produce deploy test without need
  of third party servers.

Personal projects that I started/I am doing
===========================================

* `Know-How`_: Unified knowledge repository.
* Own office: I emptied a shed to transform it into an office (very long-term).
  It looks very nice empty; now I must fil it of me!

Good weekend! :D
