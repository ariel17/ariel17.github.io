*Motley: You know, sometimes I really wonder what the point is of estimation.*
*Developers are never accurate on any project longer than 3 days! The only*
*real way to estimate is to go off gut feel and leverage the PANOOMA*
*technique.*

*Maven: You’re right – estimation is hard. But, fortunately there are some*
*techniques we can leverage to improve the accuracy of our estimates. And by*
*the way, what is the PANOOMA technique of estimation? That’s not one I have*
*heard of.*

*Motley: Pull A Number Out Of My Ass! That’s really what ends up happening*
*anyway.*
