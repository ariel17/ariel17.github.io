title: From zero to vim
---

When I say _from zero_ I mean _from none configuration_, so I will not write
about how to use it or install it; I will leave that to you.

# ... but why?

So, I have been using ViM for a few years. But I am currently learning to use
some IDEs like [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to expand my toolbox, but
I always come back to ViM. Despite the simulator plugins available for those
IDEs, they do not fully simulates the behavior and that's quite a shame.

# Hands on

I have it a non-fresh but unconfigured installation. I use ViM when I need to
edit text, so I will use it from programming to editing CSV or blog posts.
Because of it, my requirements are as follow:

### Programming languages:

- Golang
- Python
- Javascript

  - ES5/ES6
  - jQuery
  - reactJS

- Java

### Design:

- HTML
- LESS
- SASS
- CSS3

### Documentation:

- RestructuredText
- Markdown

Other file support:

### Plugin source and management

- [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/) as the plugin indexer.
- Pathogen
