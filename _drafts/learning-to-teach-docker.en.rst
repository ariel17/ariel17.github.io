In Movile_ (yes, |imback|_) had begun an auto-training program, where the
classes where scheduled with `Open Space`_ technique. One topic porposed by me
was to learnd Docker_ since I never worked with this tools.

It was my work to find the ways to bring someone who could teach us this
technology... but my pride and I never pretended that this person to be any
other than me, so I sit my head to learn Docker_ this last weekend. The result
was |slides|_ (made with Sphinx_ and Hieroglyph_) and a 25 minutes talk
:).

I need to improve:

* Slow down the talk velocity on topics: the talk was thinked to last ~40
  minutes and instead it lasted a bit more than the half of time.

* Change the voice tone to avoid monotony.

The next class is about Python_ :D I'm kinda happy.
