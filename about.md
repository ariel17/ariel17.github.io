My name is **Ariel Gerardo RÃ­os** and I am a father, husband and software
developer.

![Me](/assets/about/me-900x900.png)

I like to spend time learning new things and how the head works learning it,
building habits and understanding how human relationships work. Also [I like to
read (a lot)][1], do some write and play the guitar, although I'm not spending
on the last two the time I would like... but I'm working on it.

What about coding? I like to code :), learning new technologies but also
getting ready for management and leadership.
