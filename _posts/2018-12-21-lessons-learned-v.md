- **Say NO with trust**: If there is something I am not comfortable with, I
  just have to say it.
- **Pre-mortems are better than post-mortems**: Thinking ahead of time about
  future problems is better than having to give explanations about why I didn't
  think in possible failure scenarios.
- **Trust no one**: no matter if I have confirmation from external sources, I
  have to obtain my own confirmations.
