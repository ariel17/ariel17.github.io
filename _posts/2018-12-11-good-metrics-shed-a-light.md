Quote from ["Codermetrics" by Jonathan Alexander](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12381856-codermetrics):

> To evaluate whether a metric itself is good or bad, you can ask yourself the
> following questions:
> 
> • Is the metric relatively easy to describe and understand?
>
> • Can the metric show me something I don’t already know?
> 
> • Does the metric clearly relate to a goal I care about?
> 
> If the answer to any of the above questions is clearly no, then the metric
> either needs more work, or it should probably be discarded.
