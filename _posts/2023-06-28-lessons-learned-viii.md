* Go and do whatever your team needs, no matter your position. Make the wheel to
  start moving. Don't wait for directions, go and do and correct course if
  deltas are identified.

  Example: the team is new, there is no repository, no clear indications for
  when it will be provided. Go and create it, put the simplest name and fix it
  when the definition appears. Start reflecting your progress on issues.
