* **Use "Getting Things Done" framework:** It has an innate motivation
  component.

* **Be wise about choosing wich technical debt I will create:** It can come
  back in the night to hunt me.

* **I forget everything when multitasking:** I must keep a journal/diary/ticket
  system to collect any progress on multiple battle fronts.

* **Leaders must be predecibles:** My schedule should be planner to suffer the
  less on unexpected events.

* **Expose everything I do in my tracking system:** Keep work visible for
  everyone.

* **Test as you fly, fly as you test:** An interesting [NASA principle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/623243/test-what-you-fly-fly-what-you-test-nasa-principle).

* **If I don't know, I just have to say it:** If I say that task is completed
  but I am not sure about it, I am risking my reputation and my work quality,
  as I am showing inconsistency. Better to be stuck to reality and measure my
  word in calm, showing progress but not exposing myself.

**If I have the truth, then I must try to proof me false** [I want to be right
  more often](https://ozanvarol.com/want-to-be-right-more-often-try-this/), so
  if I am right, proof me wrong will show more light on the subject.

* **Taking ownership? First, show me the project's mission:** When working with
  multiple projects, I must have a clear field vision about what is more
  important and what can wait. This information will guide me on which one to
  take first when facing two or more critical bugs.

* **Plan and organize directives when coaching:** I have to understand the task
  I am delegating, scopes and fulfill requirements if necessary. This will
  improve communication and confidence.
