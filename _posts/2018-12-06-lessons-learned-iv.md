* **Use "Getting Things Done" framework:** It has an innate motivation
  component.

* **Be wise about choosing wich technical debt I will create:** It can come
  back in the night to hunt me.

* **I forget everything when multitasking:** I must keep a journal/diary/ticket
  system to collect any progress on multiple battle fronts.

* **Leaders must be predecibles:** My schedule should be planner to suffer the
  less on unexpected events.

* **Expose everything I do in my tracking system:** Keep work visible for
  everyone.

* **Test as you fly, fly as you test:** An interesting [NASA principle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/623243/test-what-you-fly-fly-what-you-test-nasa-principle).

* **If I don't know, I just have to say it:** If I say that it is completed and
  I'm not sure about it, I am risking my reputation and my work quality, as I
  am showing inconsistency. Better to be stuck to reality and measure my word
  in calm, showing progress but not exposing myself.
