title: Yes, you hate Continuous Delivery (and your team too)

Yes, you hate it. And your team does too. Because it forces you to be
continuously responsible and aware of what is going to production and that, my
friend, is very hard.

Since software development processes simulates industrial factory ones you can
easily point your finger to the bottleneck in your delivery chain, if you look
closely (and blamelessly on intention), because you are as fast as your slowest
link, my friend. Your team's code is not providing value and this is why it
exists in the first place. Why?

A lot of reassons, of course. You have them, I have them. But I encourage you to
ask and validate the following:

- _"Is it hard to deploy to production?"_
- _"Do people avoid to make code reviews?"_

Any positive result confirms my initial statement: your team hates C.D. At least
in your current work environment.

### What can I do?

I'm glad you ask. I would try the following, in this order (changes from
_inside_ to _outside_):

- **Make your code reviews a first class citizens in your development process.**
  Make sure your team mates understand how doing and priorizing it can unlock
  productivity and learning from each other. This step is key because it will
  generate stress into the deploy mechanism, and in the following step.

- **Ask your team about the deployment process: what would they change? And help
  change one thing at time** so they can unleash the value into the company and
  your customers.

### Next?

That thing about _code reviews as first citizens_ has a lot to be developed; I
am working on it. Ah, I didn't say anything about blame and secondary
feelings... We are people, right? People in the middle of a moving machinery.
