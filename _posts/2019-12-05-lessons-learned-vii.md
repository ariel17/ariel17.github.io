* **I have bad memory for casual topics / personal long term projects:** Things
  that I not come back often or long term project that I use to make progress
  casually makes me hard to remember its details.

* **Flip weaknesses to strengths:** The previous item made me mad. I don't like
  this weakness but I took a long deep breath and switched the thinking: *this
  could lead to a new strength*. Taking action on in should lead to a gain for
  those projects (less re-take curve) and for me (more fresh things in my
  mind).

* **Daily logging:** Trello for week + daily planning makes goals clear. The
  downside is that it could lead to burnout due to stress on my own pressure to
  complete them if the scope of tasks is too much.

* **Make time worth; complete tasks in one shot makes more time available:**
  Take a task, sit my ass down and complete it in one shot makes more time
  available in the future for other tasks. Use with caution: the task has to be
  meaningful.
