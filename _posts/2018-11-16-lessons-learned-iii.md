- _Ariel, aren't you going too fast?_: I must check project criticity. What is
  more valuable? 0 errors + everybody happy or multiple customs at the phone &
  the team screaming at you? It is, and must be truth always. Am I willing to
  take the risk to damage my/my team image and client relation by releasing to
  production an untested code? Am I crazy??
- API-First design: it worths every time spent on it. [Just choose a platform](https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/)
  and add it to the development cycle.
- Be open to other's solutions: really, I must give it a try everytime.
- Be *always* polite: it will keep the doors open for another chance.
- _Men down! men down!_: If motivation goes down for several days, the way to
  keep track of productivity is to pick the best day I had and compare to it.
