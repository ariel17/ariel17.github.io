- ***Ariel, aren't you going too fast?****:* I must check project criticity. What is
  more valuable? 0 errors + everybody happy or multiple customs at the phone &
  the team screaming at you? The first is, and must be truth always. Am I
  willing to take the risk to damage my (team's) image and client relation by
  releasing to production an untested code? Am I crazy??

- **API-First design:** it worths every time spent on it. [Just choose a platform](https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/)
  and add it to the development cycle.

- **Be open to other's solutions:** really, I must give it a try everytime.

- **Be** ***always*** **polite:** it will keep the doors open for another chance.

- ***Men down! men down!****:* If motivation goes down for several days, the way to
  keep track of productivity is to pick the best day I had and compare to it.
  [Be the best version of yourself](https://twitter.com/PicardTips/status/1061346044384968704?s=08).

- **It is my responsability to say NO:** Protect the projects from quick solutions
  that atempt againts maintainability/scalability/resilience or promotes
  cohesion.

- **Missing documentation is an oportunity to expand knowledge:** When I take
  ownership on a legacy project, I have to make time to know it; documenting
  is a good place to getting to know it.
