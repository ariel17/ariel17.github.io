Every now and then, my mind winkers for things to build. Usually I canalize this
into some house-fixing thing, but I've found something very interesting here: a
VERY COOL looking tiny mechanical keyboard.

Too much detail into the PCB board in the video IMO, but looks really cool and
for sure not expensive. Seems to be a dare!
