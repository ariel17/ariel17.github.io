title: From zero to vim
---

When I say _from zero_ I mean _from none configuration_, so I will not write
about how to use it or install it; I will leave that to you.

# ... but why?

I have been using ViM for a few years (8 aprox). But I am currently learning to
use some IDEs like [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to expand my toolbox, but
I always come back to ViM. Despite the simulator plugins available for those
IDEs, they do not fully simulates the behavior and that's quite a shame.

# What do I need

I have it a non-fresh but unconfigured installation. I use ViM when I need to
edit text, so I will use it from programming to editing CSV or blog posts.
Because of it, my requirements are as follow:

**Programming languages:**

* Golang
* Python
* Javascript

  - ES5/ES6
  - jQuery
  - reactJS

* Java

**Design:**

* HTML
* LESS
* SASS
* CSS3

**Documentation:**

* RestructuredText
* Markdown

**Other file support:**

* TODO

**Plugin source and management:**

* [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/) as the plugin indexer.
* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

# Hands on

This is all for now. I will keep posting on my progress.
