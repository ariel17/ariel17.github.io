"This, then, is the human problem: there is a price to be paid for every
increase in consciousness. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being
more sensitive to pain. By remembering the past we can plan for the future. But
the ability to plan for the future is offset by the "ability" to dread pain and
to fear of the unknown. Furthermore, the growth of an acute sense of the past
and future gives us a corresponding dim sense of the present. In other words, we
seem to reach a point where the advantages of being conscious are outweighed by
its disadvantages, where extreme sensitivity makes us unadaptable."

by Alan W. Watts, "The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety"
