## On communication

* **Be transparent, but don't freak others out:** show progress on the topic I
  am working on but I shouldn't bother my public with internal problems unless
  it can provide a benefit (maybe they can help to solve/unblock it). Intead I
  should say "I will keep the work on it until it is solved/fixed".

* **I have to go to meetings with a summary:** especially when the meeting is
  a work done report; I'm not good for on-the-fly summaries.

* **When I ask someone to work in my favor, I must begin the question with
  *"what do you think about making X... ?"*:** It places a collaborative stage
  between the person and me to solve a problem instead of just delegating a
  problem and disappear.

## On project management

* **Put my full effort on blockers immediatly:** I must not make a path to avoid
  them. It has to be solved as soon as possible.

* **Ownership is the path to control and quality:** If I have ownership over a
  project it will grow under my protection and I will have focus on the
  technical debt. Success on the project will be attached to my own success.
